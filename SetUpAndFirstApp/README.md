First Install vscode and nodejs
Run below commands 

Update npm:

[sudo] npm install -g npm 

Update CLI :

[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular-cli (this cmd only if cli is already installed previously)

npm cache verify 

npm instsll -g @angular-cli



After installing CLI and updating NPM we need to create a new project 

https://angular.io/cli -- Official doc

go to folder you want to create project and give below cmd 

ng new my-first-app --no-strict (We will see about --no-strict later)
No-for Angular routing
